  <h3>Hey there!</h3>
  <p>
    I'm Oskar, currently studying computer science at the University of Potsdam,
    and I love building efficient, clean, and responsive software.</p>
  <p>
    In my spare time, I enjoy learning about system design, algorithms,
    and personal projects that challenge me to grow.</p>
